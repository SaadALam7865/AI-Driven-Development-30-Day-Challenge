## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains my submission for **Task 2** of the AI-Driven Development 30-Day Challenge. The assignment focuses on understanding the fundamental concepts of AI-driven development, including the Nine Pillars framework, M-Shaped developer concept, and the importance of Specification-Driven Development.

**Instructor:** Sir Hamzah Syed  
**Time Allocated:** 1 Hour  
**Total Marks:** 10  
**Deadline:** 48 Hours from class

## 📚 Assignment Structure

The assignment is divided into three main parts:

### Part A - Theory Questions (Short Answers)

**Question 1: Nine Pillars Understanding**
- Why AI Development Agents are beneficial for system architects
- How Nine Pillars help developers become M-Shaped

**Question 2: Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development**
- Problems with Vibe Coding after one week
- How SDD prevents those problems

**Question 3: Architecture Thinking**
- Impact of architecture-first thinking on developer role
- Importance of thinking in layers and systems

### Part B - Practical Task

**Objective:** Generate a specification for an email validation function using AI CLI tool

**Tool Used:** Gemini CLI

**Requirements:**
- Must contain "@" symbol
- Must contain valid domain (.com, .org, etc.)
- Should return clear error messages

### Part C - Multiple Choice Questions

5 MCQs covering:
- Specification-Driven Development
- AI-Driven Development mindset
- Vibe Coding limitations
- AI CLI agents advantages
- M-Shaped Developer definition

## 🔑 Key Concepts Covered

### 1. **Nine Pillars of AIDD**
The integrated system that allows a single developer to function like an entire team:
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- AI CLI Tools
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Development Agents
- Specifications
- Architecture-first thinking
- And more...

### 2. **M-Shaped Developer**
A developer with deep expertise in 2-4 complementary domains, enabled by AI bridging knowledge gaps.

**Evolution:**
- **I-Shaped:** Single skill depth
- **T-Shaped:** One deep skill + broad knowledge
- **M-Shaped:** Multiple deep skills across related domains

### 3. **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)**
Writing clear, executable specifications before implementation - formalizing human intent.

**Benefits:**
- Clear requirements upfront
- Reduced bugs and confusion
- Better maintainability
- Easier team collaboration

### 4. **3-Layer Architecture**
- **Layer 1 (Models):** AI intelligence (GPT, Claude, Gemini)
- **Layer 2 (IDEs):** Workspace (VS Code, Cursor)
- **Layer 3 (Agents):** Autonomous tools (Gemini CLI, Claude Code)

### 5. **Vibe Coding vs SDD**

| Vibe Coding | Specification-Driven Development |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| No planning | Clear planning first |
| Quick start | Structured approach |
| Messy after 1 week | Maintainable long-term |
| Hard to extend | Easy to scale |
| Intuition-based | Specification-based |

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Gemini CLI** - AI Command Line Interface for generating specifications
- **PowerShell** - Terminal for running CLI commands
- **Markdown** - Documentation format
- **Git & GitHub** - Version control and repository hosting

## 📖 Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, I have learned:

✅ **Architecture-First Thinking:** How to approach software development with system design in mind rather than jumping straight into coding

✅ **AI Agent Utilization:** How to leverage AI CLI tools like Gemini to handle repetitive tasks and focus on high-level problem solving

✅ **Specification-Driven Development:** The importance of writing clear specifications before implementation to avoid technical debt

✅ **M-Shaped Developer Path:** How AI tools enable developers to gain deep expertise in multiple domains instead of being limited to one

✅ **System Thinking:** Why thinking in layers and systems is crucial for building scalable, maintainable applications

✅ **Nine Pillars Framework:** Understanding how the integrated ecosystem of AIDD transforms the developer role from code writer to system architect
