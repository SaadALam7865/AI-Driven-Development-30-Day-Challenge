## 🧠 Key Concepts Explained

### 1️⃣ AI Turning Point (October 2025)
The moment AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude became powerful enough  
to shift developers from "coders" to "AI collaborators."

### 2️⃣ Agentic AI
AI systems that can **reason, plan, and act** autonomously — like an intelligent teammate.

### 3️⃣ Evaluation-Driven Development (EvDD)
Developers now **evaluate and improve AI-generated outputs**, instead of writing every line manually.

### 4️⃣ Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Still important in the AI era — write tests first, let AI write code to pass them.

### 5️⃣ AI Productivity Boom
Developers' productivity increased 5–10x due to AI-assisted planning, coding, debugging, and documentation.
